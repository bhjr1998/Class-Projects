When fighting against a heavy that is shooting at you, try to walk backwards, this will allow you to get more dps than they can (unless they too are using the tomislav) due the range you are creating benefits the tomislav because of it&rsquo;s increase accuracy. Also remember to abuse the silent rev by staying in a corner revved to catch someone off guard.</th>

While it is effective and can be hard to counter if the team plays it properly... you are still a sitting duck due to it promoting perma-revving. And since you move like a literal slug when revved you ain&rsquo;t gonna dodge anything.</th>

While it might seem on paper to be a good starter minigun with the slow on hit and dmg resistance&#59; it&rsquo;s actually really hard to use due to the damage reduction it has, causing you to waste more ammo and time to take them out, which is not preferred. But it's still fun to make people mad by slowing them to a crawl.</th>

The sandvich outclasses it due to it&rsquo;s healing, but it&rsquo;s still a fun option whether going shotgun only or to use it as a backup option.</th>

You usually use it to heal a teammate that needs some healing while your medic is busy, healing the medic, or to use it for yourself if your med is busy and you need some healing.
