   <h2>Red</h2>
	<h4>First</h4>
	<p>For first you generally want to stand back with the team and waiting for the enemy to come around since walking out is a death trap due to snipers.
	<h4>Second</h4>
	<p>Same story, you usually want to defend where your team plans to set-up a defense.</p>
	<h4>Third</h4>
	<p>Do not bother with trying to hold outside of tunnel, go straight into the building that third is right outside of and stay in the upper area for as long as possible with your team.</p>
	<h4>Fourth</h4>
	<p>Defending outside of fourth can be possible but can also get you overrun easily so it is best advised to do a soft hold at best unless the enemy team is really that bad.
	For defending inside try to stay towards the right side since on the left you are more vulnerable and most people tend to push from the right.
	Also, if possible, have a fellow engineer to place a teleporter exit next to the dropdown area that is right in front of right side entrance so you can have a nasty headclip to enemies to walk inside.

   <h2>Blu</h2>
   <h4>First</h4>
   <p>Push towards right, get a good uber, destory their hold. If unable, try again. Don&rsquo;t bother for pushing left, you&rsquo;ll be too far back to really do anything and will just take more damage.</p>
    <h4>Second</h4>
        <p>Again, stay towards the right when pushing and go through. It is a good option to either straight through tracks or to try to get on the rocks to left of track if you are able to do so. But be weary because of sniper and demo.
    <h4>Third</h4>
        <p>Usually push in through left to destroy their hold. You could do right but if a pyro does an airblast you&rsquo;ll fall down and have to climb back up so keep that in mind if you attempt to push that way.</p>
    <h4>Fourth</h4>
        <p>Again, left. You can hold to the right of the choke but generally you want to push out left due to it leading to spawn and the engineer setup with only being airblasted to a wall and not off a catwalk.</p>
