        <h4>Bath House</h4>
            <p>For lakeside you want to have your team hold in bath house due to how it is a safe haven to defend the point and is much less susceptible to spam and sniper sightlines. For as heavy try to hold inside the house without exposing yourself to spam or snipers too much.</p>
    <h4>Behind Point</h4>
        <p>If you fail to secure bath house, you are generally going to end up behind the point or ruins, but try to avoid holding in ruins due to how easily overrun you get. Holding positions are usually behind the point, around the obelisk, and the headclip side that near the large ammo pack on the point.</p>
    <h4>Ruins</h4>
        <p>As stated before try to not hold ruins due to how easy it is to get overrun. If you hold there try to hold as close to bath house entrance as possible, especially the ledge that essentially leads to mid.</p>
