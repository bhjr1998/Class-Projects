    <h2>General</h2>
        <h4>Behind Point</h4>
            <p>This is one of the two major holding spots and it is behind point. Usually as heavy you want to both apply pressure when the enemy over extend and also look out for any flankers or an opening to secure point if your team have not done so. Usually you will just stand near caution, behind rock, or around the rock itself when holding behind point.</p>
        <h4>Cliff</h4>
            <p>When holding cliff you either do it as a team or you can go up there to protect your team holding behind point. Try to stay in a spot that can mostly not be so easily shot at from their concrete while still getting a good view on point and on your team. This is a good spot due to how hard it is for enemies to get to you and the spy only has really one way to get to you and that is from the back entrance. Also if you want to be more aggressive stand on the rock in front of cliff so that if you are taking damage you can easily unrev and go back to cliff for protection.</p>
        <h4>Grass/Concrete</h4>
            <p>Holding here is a literal death trap due to how easy it is to take spam and the nasty sightline sniper can get the momment you go near the staircase.</p>
