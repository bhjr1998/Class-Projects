    <h2>Mid</h2>
        <p>How you rollout to mid is usually how your team wants to do it, but it is usually going through big door and going right to the enemies choke and try to hold there to cut them off from retreating that way. Generally try to not to even attempt to push through big door as heavy into second due to the possiblility of being overrun.</p>
    <h2>Second</h2>
        <h4>Defense</h4>
            <p>Hold either near choke or at the balcony that leads to river. Try to avoid big door unless your team has control of it but if pushing back just go through choke unless the entire enemy team is dead.</p>
        <h4>Offense</h4>
            <p>Go through choke, do not bother with big door unless they all got wiped at mid and your team has secured second. Try to be the last going through choke in a push due to the general openess of the area would make it difficult for you to do anything major so just go in last and provide supressing fire for your team.</p>
    <h2>Third</h2>
        <h4>Defense</h4>
            <p>If in lobby try to do a softish type of hold but be prepared to retreat to hard hold the actual last point. Try to hold on the high ground near shutter, due to the immense coverage of the point and river makes you a threat and if the enemy team pushes through river you will be hard to get too. But be weary if they attempt to push through shutter but still try to hold your ground especially if you have uber avaliable.</p>
        <h4>Offense</h4>
            <p>Unless trying to quickly push after getting second, usually never go to mid through lower lobby, try to go through shutter or river to push into last. If pushing through river, you can choose to go straight out or do a slight detour to water to get behind the point to clear things out as well.</p>
