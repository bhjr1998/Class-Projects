   <h2>Red</h2>
        <h4>First</h4>
            <p>Never go past stairs, just don&rsquo;t do it. Snipers will just easily take you out. Hold behind stairs or the little cliff that extends from the hill behind you and hold there. Don&rsquo;t hide in playground, it&rsquo;s a death trap due to how they can easily spam it from tracks or on top of playground. If the sentry goes down and you know you can&rsquo;t rehold it, just book it to the hill behind you and either hold up there or on porch in front of spawn.</p>
        <h4>Second</h4>
            <p>Hold on hill by the side cave entrance if possible. If not try to hold under the stairs that leads to window. If that&rsquo;s not possible try to hold near gun or by the little gap in the support beams under window.</p>
        <h4>Third</h4>
            <p>Hold on porch from elbow, try to hold on to it because of how powerful and good it can be. If heavily injured go back to elbow to heal up and go back out, if not possible try to hold spiral. Never try to peak rollercoaster nor go to the side house, it will just end in your demise due to the sightlines you would be exposed to.</p>
        <h4>Fourth</h4>
            <p>Hold upper lobby. Either spiral or in the back by the medium healthpack and looking at stairs depending where you or your demo are holding. Heavy usually covers the stairs in the back. For last ditch try to get to the stairs by the end of tracks and defend the cart from there, be wearly of people going to under and poking you and spies dropping down from crates from above.</p>
   <h2>Blu</h2>
        <h4>First</h4>
            <p>Two options when out of gate: use fists of steel to push cart up or try to gain ground leftside. When you gain ground either push as a team left side with uber or try to get a hold right side along with your flank. Either are good but if their sniper dies going right can be better due to being free to cross sightlines.</p>
        <h4>Second</h4>
            <p>Go over the hill and try to gain ground. Either push past stairs or go our through window with uber to take out the enemy hold and push forward.</p>
        <h4>Third</h4>
            <p>Don&rsquo;t bother for under rollercoaster to side house unless you going for really cheeky play. Usually hold in the old red spawn and push up hill and gain control of elbow and porch to allow your team to push outside to allow the cart through.</p>
        <h4>Fourth</h4>
            <p>Have team push and try to gain control of upper lobby through under or spiral. Don&rsquo;t attempt to cross to upper lobby back stairs due to the sightline you cross from tracks. If you gain control try to keep control. A good position to be in to support your team pushing the cart is going to the crates providing cover fire from there.</p>
