   <h2>How Your Weapon Works</h2> 
    <p>
	Miniguns work by firing a "bullet", which is when an ammo is expended, but actually spits out 4 pellets that each do a separate amount of damage.
	These are mostly random where they land within a circle (the default crosshair gives a good representation of it).
	There is also a mechanic in which you need to be revved for a full second in order to get full damage and accuracy.
	Initially you start out with 50% total less damage and accuracy and the more you are revved you more it increases to 100% when revved for a full second.
	Timing for this is the same for all miniguns, which means that when the brass beast is ready to fire it is actually at around 70% dmg and accuracy and doesn&rsquo;t need to wait too long to get the full damage and accuracy potential.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Jump Revving</h2>
	<p>
	It&rsquo;s a simple yet effective trick.
	To do it you simply jump than rev, this will give you more length when you rev up than just walking while revving up.
	Use this nearly constantly when you need to be closer to the people you need to shoot.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Headclipping</h2>
	<p>
	Headclipping abuses the fact that with nearly all hitscan weapons, the bullets go out of your face instead of the middle of your body as do most projectiles work.
	This is a positioning tool in which you are able to shoot but only really your head is visible if the spot allows for it.
	It is a great way to try to conceal as much of your giant body as possible to evade damage and make it harder for your enemy to shoot you.</p>
	<p>
	Below are some pictures to better illustrate it, with the lakeside spot showing the first person view and the third person view to get an idea as to how powerful it can be.

	<h2>Sandvich refilling</h2>
	<p>
	When sandvich is on cooldown and you are at full health, you can grab any size health kit and get the sandvich, or any lunchbox item, back instantly.
	It is good to do this in scenarios where your team is holding a spot, in which you throw sandvich on the ground, pick up the health kit, and it will respawn with the sandvich being out.
	It&rsquo;s especially good due to the sandvich lasting for 30 seconds on the ground while the respawn time for health kits is 10 seconds, so you essentially can have two health kits out for 20 seconds.
	So if a teammate needs some good healing give them a sandvich, pick up the nearby health kit, and give them another one.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sandvich and Buffalo Steak Sandvich act as medium health kits when thrown.
	Second Banana and Dalokohs Bar are small health kits when thrown.
