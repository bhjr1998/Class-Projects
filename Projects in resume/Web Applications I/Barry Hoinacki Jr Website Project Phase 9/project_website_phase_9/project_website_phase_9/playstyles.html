   <h2>Aggressive</h2> 
    <p>This is the playstyle in which you are constantly trying to go to the enemy all the time rather than wait for them to come to you.
	Being aggressive on more neutral modes like King of the Hill or Five Control Points is a more risky maneuver but can have good payoff if pulled off correctly.
	It is usually a matter of knowing who you will be fighting against and choosing to go after them or exploiting a weakness such as the enemy having a blindspot, going through it, and getting key picks like a medic or demoman.
	It also means constantly supplying suppressing fire on the enemy if they come into sightline.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Passive</h2>
	<p>
	Passive playstyle is a lot like being a bodyguard for your team in which you are always looking out for them and not trying to go lone wolf.
	This is when you are just protecting your team from imminent threats and constantly giving out sandviches.
	With this playstyle just stick to your team and either push with them or stay back to take care of anyone trying to flank you.
	You still want to push with your team when they do so just don&rsquo;t stand back when you do an uber push: be with the team and try to be the main pusher.
	</p>
	
	<h2>A Mix Of Both</h2>
    <p>This is essentially constantly flipping between the two modes of being aggressive and playing passive.
	This one is probably the best one to get used to due to how it will help your decision making in many situations.
	The trick with this is knowing when to switch which is you knowing when to be aggressive or passive.
	Switching between them can be a difficult task but can come more naturally on which is best from experience and knowing how the match is going.
